# RaBot -- Learning by coding a rabbit!

RaBot is a project aiming at creating a vivid and interactive environment for children to learn computer programming, it's also our project for the course <Software Engineering> and it might be used by JiSuanKe.com for further development.

## Details
The programming language children use to control the rabbit will be [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/) (or something based on it). Users need to program their rabbit to accomplish various tasks, and finally let them eat carrots~
